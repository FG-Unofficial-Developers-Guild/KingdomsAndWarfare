# 1.3 Harrowing Update
  
### Dev NOTES

The ActionsManager.actionDirect function isn't being overridden, so I might need to think of another way to interrup the rollling process. I was hoping that by setting rRolls to nil it wouldn't roll any, but I'll have to trace how that data moves through the ActionsManager.
