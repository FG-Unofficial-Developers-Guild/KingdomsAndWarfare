# 1.3 Harrowing Update

New features:

* When a unit is reduced to half hit points, it automatically makes a morale test due to being diminished. On a failure, it takes an extra damage.
* When a unit targets another unit that has the Harrowing trait, the attacking unit automatically makes a Morale test. On a failure, the unit gains the Harrowed effect and the attack doesn't continue. On a success, the attacking unit becomes immune to Harrow and the attack is rolled.
