# 1.2 Combat Tracker Update

One major new feature to the combat tracker!

There is a new toggle button in the combat tracker that lets you show and hide units assigned to a commander. This way when a commander starts their turn the GM can show all their units in the combat tracker while hiding all others. When their turn is done, the GM can hide that commander's units.

Future updates on this feature will include:

* Automatically showing or hiding a commander's units when their turn starts, and hiding their units when all of the units have activated
* Allowing players to end turns for their units

Known issues:

* Players cannot end their units' turns on the combat tracker, the GM must do it for them
* Units that are hidden will always have their turn skipped, regardless of the game option in the settings window
