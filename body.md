# 1.0 Release

1.0 release of the unofficial Kingdoms and Warfare fantasy grounds extension. Features include:

* Master index lists for units and domains (accessed via the shortcut bar)
* Units function like NPCs, and can be added to encounters, the combat tracker, and their tokens to map
* Units can perform tests targeting other units, and damage is dealt on a successful attack or power test
* Basic effect handling for unit stats
* The domain sheet has a power pool where numbers can be dropped to add, or clicked/dragged out to spend (by players or GMs)
* The domain sheet also has room for tracking officer reactions/proficiency uses, features, powers, and development points
* A number of small quality of life features

This release contains the minimal amount required to run domains and warfare. More features, automation, and enhancements will be added in an ongoing basis.
