# 1.5 - Character Update

## Features

* Powers on the Action tab of the PC sheet can now have Unit Test actions added to them. These unit tests can be used to handle martial advantages for player commanders. You can define which stat to roll and the DC for the roll, and these actions can be forced onto units by targeting or drag/dropping the dice directly onto a unit.
* Added a new sidebar shortcut for martial advantages labaled "Advantages". These can be drag/dropped directly onto the PC's actions tab in the same way that spells can.
* Where applicable, when a martial advantage is dropped onto the PC's action tab, it will automatically create relevant actions for the martial advantage (tests, damage, healing, and effects);
