# 1.2.1 Combat Tracker Update

Fixes and updates:

* Players can now use the combat tracker's "end turn" button to end turns for their character's units.
* Unit in the combat tracker are automatically shown if the last active non-unit actor was that unit's commander. This way, all units owned by a particular commander will also be shown until it's another commander's turn.
* Dice can now be directly dropped onto a domain's power pool. Doing so will roll the die and add it to the power pool.
* Fixed issue where Rally and domain skill checks were not rolling with advantage or disadvantage if the desktop buttons were checked

Known issues:

* Units that are hidden will always have their turn skipped, regardless of the game option in the settings window
