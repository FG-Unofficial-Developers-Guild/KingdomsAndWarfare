# Unofficial Kingdoms And Warfare (by MCDM) extension for Fantasy Grounds
Adds Fantasy Grounds support for MCDM's Kingdoms and Warfare D&amp;D 5th edition supplement.

In order to get started using this extension, go to the "Releases" section, found on the right side of the page and click on whatever version number is displayed there. From the release page, scroll down until you see the attachments, and click "UnofficialKingdomsAndWarfare.ext" to download it. Place that ext file in your Fantasy Grounds extensions folder, which by default is %appdata%\SmiteWorks\Fantasy Grounds\extensions. You can also find this folder by opening up Fantasy Grounds and clicking the folder icon in the upper left corner of the startup window to open up Fantasy Grounds' data folder, and then selecting 'extensions' from within there.

Once installed, when you go to load a 5th edition campaign, you can enable "Unofficial Kingdoms and Warfare" from the list of extensions.
